# FantasticRobotArm
My repository is a robot arm with its parts, You can use any 3D program to collect it, There is a picture for the output.
First step put the "Base" in suitable place, Then put the "Waist" in the top, After that put the "Arm1" and "Arm2" but make sure it make 90d with the "Base"; Because itâ€™s the initial position.
Finally put the "Gripper" in the top of the shape.
Well done!
